Some library changes:

- JSON style attributes can be made strict for key transforms 
- Small changes to signatures in `LmxmlParsers` trait, adding extensibility
- Transforms now work against attributes and text nodes
- Added a `CommentNode` which can be converted now
- The `Lmxml` object has been refactored to `DefaultLmxml` as users can now define their own `Lmxml` with included modules.
